TRANSACTION:

To create a transaction, you must include an amount and either a payment method nonce or payment_method_token.

result = PayMo.Transaction.sale({     
"amount": "10.00",     
"payment_method_nonce": nonce_from_the_client,     
"options": {         
"submit_for_settlement": True     
} 
})

result = PayMo.Transaction.sale({     
"payment_method_token": "the_token",     
"amount": "10.00" })

SETTLEMENT:

1.	When creating a transaction, using the option.submit_for_settlement option.
2.	Using Transaction.submit_for_settlement():
result = PayMo.Transaction.submit_for_settlement
("the_transaction_id")
if
result.is_success:
settled_transaction = result.transaction
else:
print ("unverified: You've never had a transaction with this user before. Are you sure you would like to proceed with this payment?")
If the transaction cannot be found, it will throw "unverified: You've never had a transaction with this user before. Are you sure you would like to proceed with this payment?"exception. The transaction must be authorized to settle.
